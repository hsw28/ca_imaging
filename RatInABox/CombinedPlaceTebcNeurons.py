'''
Python class template for CombinedPlaceTebcNeurons that integrates both place cell and tEBC
cell functionalities. This class is designed to be used with the RatInABox framework.
It includes a balance parameter to adjust the contribution of place cell activity versus
tEBC cell activity for each neuron.

# Example usage
environment = None  # Replace with your actual environment
combined_neurons = CombinedPlaceTebcNeurons(environment, N=900, tEBC_data=your_tEBC_data, place_cell_data=your_place_cell_data, balance_factor=0.5)

# During simulation
# Update firing rates based on position, stimulus, and time
combined_neurons.update_firing_rate(current_position, stimulus, current_time)
