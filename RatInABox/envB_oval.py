'''
Place and grid cell rate maps were generated from a real exploration trajectory using
the open source Python software RatInABox. The respective activity rates are then used
to train a logistic regressor to predict the real activity of each individual neurons.
To evaluate each model performance, we computed a F1 score for each neuron using
a place input model, which penalizes both incorrect classifications of active and inactive periods.
