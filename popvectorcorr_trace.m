%population vector correlation using calcium traces
%Filtering: The data are filtered using a high-pass filter to remove slow drifts, which can obscure true neuronal signals in calcium imaging data.
%Normalization: Each cellâ€™s activity is normalized using z-score normalization, which standardizes the data, making it easier to compare across neurons.
%Mean Response Calculation: The average activity for each neuron across all time points is calculated. This simplifies the data from a time series for each neuron to a single average value per neuron per environment.
%Population Vector Correlation: The correlation between these average activities across the two environments is calculated to determine how similar the overall neural activity patterns are between the two conditions.
%Visualization: Bar graphs show the average activity for each neuron in each environment, and a scatter plot compares these directly, providing visual insights into the correlation and potential linear relationships.
