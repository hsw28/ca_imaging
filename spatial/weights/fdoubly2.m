function [doubly_d]=fdoubly2(d)
%
%[doubly_d]=fdoubly2(d)
%
%This function takes a non-negative, symmetric weight matrix and makes it doubly stochastic
%(both rows and columns sum to 1).
%
%INPUT:
%
%d is a n by n, non-negative, and symmetric weight matrix.
%
%OUTPUT:
%
%doubly_d is a n by n symmetric and doubly stochastic weight matrix.
%
%NOTES:
%
%If a matrix is overly sparse, this function may not converge. Also, this function can be somewhat slow for large matrices.
%You can adjust the maximum iterations or the convergence criterion in cond1
%to improve accuracy at the cost of performance and vice-versa. The
%function may work for some asymmetric matrices, but this should not be
%expected.
